# NIGHT-LIGHT-UINO

## Intro

### Presentation
- pictures, videos

### Description & Requirements
- DIY night light using arduino and his friends
- philosophy: user friendly, minimalistic, hidden, no rgb
- why arduino? im a programmer, i want to code something
- 2 led strips, each controlled by a potentiometer -> increasing brightness

### How it works
- how to on and off
- light animations


## Hardware
- Everything you need to know how to build the project for yourself

### Overview
- skizze

### The Components
- Controller - arduino nano every, why
- L1, L2, which type of led strips, why
- P1, P2, explain potentiometer type and its pins
- connection with audio jacks, divison into modules, better for maintenance
- I/O switch

### Shopping List
- Arduino nano every
- potis
- aux connections
- led strips
- led defuser
- power unit
- wood strip
- total cost

### Schematic
- connectors wiring
- wiring Overview
- pcb layout

### Assembly
- case
- potentiometer attachment to night stand
- led strips installement in defuser, doubleshot technique
- defuser attachment to bed back board


## Software
- adafruit neopixel library used

### Animation
- explaination of different animation stages
- using animations to justify using an arduino

### Testing
- why tests were used
- different led strip types
- prototype code snippets
    - potentiometer test
    - two potentiometers test
    - led strip test
    - two led strips test
    - control led strip with poti test

### Main
- main code file

## Unresolved Issues
- tail led flickering when other strip is changing brightness

## Conclusion
- last sentence: so this is it - an over engineered night light, because thats what i do
- dont hesitate to improve this project
